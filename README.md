## üé∂ About

Spotify's shuffle feature is great for discovering new music, but it can disrupt the intended flow of playlists, especially for genres like jam bands where multiple tracks create a cohesive experience. **After Eleanor** solves this by allowing users to define groups of songs that will always play in sequence, maintaining the integrity of their musical journey even in shuffle mode.

The name comes from a friend of mine who offered up the idea one morning saying that he wished Spotify could group songs together like the Jerry Garcia Band's After Midnight > Eleanor Rigby > After Midnight sequence.

### Acknowledgements 

   I created this tool but I would like to give special thanks to my friend Gavin who tossed the idea to me one morning.
   As I mentioned before the name After Eleanor comes from a specific song sequence played by the Jerry Garcia Band. 
   The Sequence is a cover of J.J. Cale's "After Midnight" into The Beatles "Eleanor Rigby" and reprised back into
   J.J. Cale's "After Midnight".  When he presented the idea for the tool he used this sequence saying "I always have to 
   queue these songs together when my playlist is shuffled, I wish Spotify would just add this as a feature."
